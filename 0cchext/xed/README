XEDParse is a library to parse MASM-like plaintext instructions to the XED
instruction format. The library is meant to have quick access to assembly
in certain low-level programs (such as debuggers).

Currently finished:
- parsing instructions to an internal data structure
- translate the instruction base to XED2
- translate registers to XED2
- encode the translated structure
- translate values
- translate memory arguments

Todo:
- handle instructions with more than two operands correctly

Currently the parser can be considered reasonably fast, it parses about 
200 000 instructions in 1,5 seconds.
